        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Today I watched myself from a time when I started my company. 

[![Yogangster](http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/OsHTLZ4L53U/hqdefault.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsHTLZ4L53U&amp;list=LLYm_qdRj_vEtyTQx2dkX6Tw)

I was unexperienced but hungry and dedicated.  
I miss those qualities. A Couple of months ago I was at my physical peak.   
Despite working out hard, it wasn't the same, it was in fact easy,   
almost slacking despite hours of bodyweight exercises and yoga every single day,   
even running with weight.   

Now I turned to programming in Python, telling myself that I have deposit enough onto my health account   
and that it is ok to slack again for a while to get other things done.     
My old self wouldn't approve such thinking, knowing where the priorities lie.  

Let this post be a reminder to myself of my old me, being content and happy, not wanting but doing,   
not dreaming but being, being present in my own me.   
I am street yogi and i don't aprove the physical slacking, not for one minute, i found myself again.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/noscript&gt;
