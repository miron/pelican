Title: When starting Javaapplications, dwm shows only white background
Tags: java terminal dwm background

I was for a search for a wm only for javaapps because of this (fvwm-crystal is very nice btw. but only with the mouse, although they claim you can operate it only with the keyboard, for me it was poore brain-damage), but there is a simple solution for this:

export AWT_TOOLKIT=MToolkit

Never ever another WindowManager again :)
