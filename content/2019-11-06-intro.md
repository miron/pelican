Slug: My USP 
Author: streetyogi
Summary: Never forget your USPs, everyone has something to contribute

As entrepreneur I develop workout concepts for the health-conscious:
* Short but periodic sequences for sedentary work, supervised and rewarded
* Yoga, body weight exercises, calisthenics, gymnastics (street workout). High- and parallel bars in parks, resistance bands, gymnastic rings, suspension trainers and climbing rope for progressive training in nature for individuals or small groups 
* Videos to enable self-reliant exercising for long term success
