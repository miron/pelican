Title: Skype 1.4 on Gentoo: Database Error
Date: 2007-06-18

Tags: linux, skype, error, dbus
Summary: Skype always was a little too comunicative 

This is because skype does not get shut down when i close it, i have to kill it manually too. (I use dwm and have no try icon)

Another Error was dbus-related, i had to start /etc/init.d/dbus.
