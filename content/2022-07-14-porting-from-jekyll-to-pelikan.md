Summary: Some Python a day, keeps the Doctor away 

A total revamp of my moddest homepage. I'm going from the github pages provided Jekyll static site generator to [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican).  
It is a lot of work, as I have to change metadata and formating of ancient articles I wrote over the years and decided to bring back.  
Those date back to [blogger](https://blogger.com), [wordpress](https://wordpress.com), and even a short time of hosting at a former company I worked for. It didn't last forever but was free :)   
Now I can use my Python skills to extend the blog, before it was Ruby, which I also liked but don't have the time anymore to learn both.
