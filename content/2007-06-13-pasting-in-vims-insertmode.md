Summary: What to do with that paste?

Sometimes you are already in vims insert mode, yanked something and want to paste it, instead of leaving insert mode, pasting, and enter insert mode again, type CTRL-O, paste with p, and you get back to insert mode automatically. Works of course for all normal mode commands.
