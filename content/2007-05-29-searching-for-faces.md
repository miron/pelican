Summary: all your base are belong to us


Came today across a new feature g00gle offers.

Search for something on G00gle Image Search, for example

images.google.com/images?q=somesearchterm and add &amp;imgtype=face to that url so with

images.google.com/images?q=somesearchterm&amp;imgtype=face you get only faces listed.
