Summary: there is a vimscript for that


Just compiled supercollider and get the error:
<pre><em>sclang: error while loading shared libraries: libscsynth.so: cannot
</em><em> open shared object file: No such file or directory
</em></pre>
my break from linux was too long, so i forgot to add /usr/local/lib to /etc/ld.so.conf and run ldconfig as root.

Found this supercollider interaction script for vim:
