Summary: Even before exams no rest for the vicked

Today i have my LPIC 101 exam, and while learning i tripped over this two examples:

`vi +"set number" somefile.txt`

`vi +/sometext somefile.txt`

The first one opens a file and numbers it and the second one opens a file and highlights the searchterm.
