        <pre><code>- [x] Self-esteem  
  I have been tested, I have passed through many tests  
  It is a gift from God that you have my attention, my life  

- [x] Strength, Endurance  
  I have passed several physical endurance tests, my fitness is of the top 1% in the world  
  You will know my physical characteristics in a second  
  I am one of the few people who can do yoga, high-level body weight  

- [x] Exercise videos in different languages  
  Video lessons and exercises to learn from the best  
  Videos about exercise  

- [x] How it started  
  I was inspired to make an exercise program for people of all ages and levels   
  My wife and I are very active and love to travel  
  Since I was introduced to yoga, I started looking for alternatives for our health  
  I started making a list of my favorite yoga poses. The list got longer and longer  

- [x] Long, progressive training sessions  
  Videos to enable self-reliant exercising for long term success  

- [x] My primary goal is to encourage people to get outside and have fun and get active  
  The idea is that people will get back in shape and the world around them will be more fun  
  My goal is to make healthy living fun  

- [x] Training is easy and rewarding 
  With your personal trainer to develop your skills in a safe and healthy environment  


- [x] Training programs for individuals and groups 
  In addition to regular sessions and competitions  
  All forms of exercise are equally important to your health  
  If you exercise for long enough, it will become an intrinsic part of your life  
  It is important that you take the time to find the right physical activities for you  

- [x] You can do more than you thought, no matter how busy your life may seem
